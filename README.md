# en-az-parallel-corpus

The directory contains an information about a parallel corpus for English-Azerbaijani and Azerbaijani-English translation tasks. The main goal of introducing the data is to help engineers and developers to create a universal language model (fine-tuned models) for Azerbaijani language. 

*Read this in other languages: [Az…ôrbaycan dili](README.az.md)*

The corpus can be obtained by writing to `rasul.karimov@skoltech.ru` or `mammad.hajili@epfl.ch`. Just state in your letter how the obtained information will be used. Whether it is a private or public research. Also, it will be really helpful to give more information about the organization you are working in.
